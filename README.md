# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Story Description

This animation showcases the evolution of the Porsche 911 across different generations, highlighting both the exterior design and the engine advancements over time. The animation consists of two main scenes: one displaying iconic Porsche 911 models and another featuring their corresponding engines. The transition between images is accompanied by randomized sound effects, while filters are selectively applied to the engine images to enhance visual contrast.

Since the animation primarily relies on images with minimal text, it follows a structured sequence:
	1.	Title Scene – Displays the title “Porsche 911s Through the Years.”
	2.	Model Scene – Showcases four Porsche 911 models.
	3.	Engine Scene – Displays the engines corresponding to each model.
	4.	Filtered Engine Scene – Applies filters to emphasize different engine components, adding visual effects for variation.

Use of 2D Arrays

The animation uses multiple 2D arrays to organize and structure its content:
	•	Text (array1): Holds the title and subtitle text that introduces the animation.
	•	Model Names (array2): Stores the names of four different Porsche 911 models, reinforcing which cars are displayed in the animation.
	•	Images (array3): Contains image file names for the Porsche 911 models (first row) and their respective engines (second row).
	•	Sounds (array4): Stores sound notes (first row) and their durations (second row), which are randomly played when images appear.

These 2D arrays structure the animation, ensuring each scene dynamically selects the correct images, text, and sounds to create an engaging visual and auditory experience.

## Image Filter Analysis

1. Grayscale Filter
	•	Removes all colors and turns the image black and white.
	•	Each pixel becomes a shade of gray based on its brightness.
	•	Dark areas stay dark, and light areas stay light.

2. Colorize Filter
	•	Changes colors based on brightness.
	•	Dark parts turn red, medium parts turn green, and bright parts turn blue.
	•	Gives the image a colorful, high-contrast look.

3. Purplize Filter (Custom)
	•	Adds a purple tint to the image.
	•	Removes green while keeping red and blue.
	•	Makes everything look more purple.

Each filter changes the image in a different way to create a unique effect!
